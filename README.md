Call Of Duty 1: United Offensive BSP recompiler
===============================================

This vibe coded toolkit can be used to manually edit maps (BSP files),
for ex. add vehicles to already existing maps.

- *dumpbsp*: dumps given .bsp file to editable text
- *mkbsp*: constructs a .bsp file based on the text output of dumpbsp

Note: if no cmdline arg is given to mkbsp then it reads from stdin.
